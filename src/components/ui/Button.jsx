// label size, radius and state values, and which hex values are banned.

// Legacy aliases for the three roles this component shipped before
// DESIGN-SYSTEM.md. "brand" was the old primary, "danger" the old critical,
// "secondary" a *filled* grey pill that Figma does not define -- it now maps
// to the outline role, which is what those call sites were reaching for (they
// were all Cancel buttons).

  // clear. Hit areas are the squares the Figma file actually draws (24/32/40
  // were all present; 48 is carried over from the button scale because 40 is
  // below the 44px touch-target guidance on phones). No text size -- the
  // child is an icon, and inlining a label into one of these would defeat
  // the point of the role. Pair with aria-label; Button does not add one.

// they are precomputed hexes (#002f9b / #002b8f for brand, #c20000 /
// #ad0000 for critical) rather than element opacity: hover:opacity-90 also
// fades the label and reads as black @10%, which is neither. Disabled keeps
// the fill per spec and is dimmed by opacity only because Figma gives no
// separate disabled colour.
