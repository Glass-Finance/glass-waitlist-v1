# Handoff: Glasspay "Phone in Hand" Auto-Playing App Demo

## Overview
A marketing hero for glasspay.app: a photo of a hand holding an iPhone, with the member app rendered **live inside the phone screen**. The screen auto-plays a looping ~57s tour of the member workflow — scrolling the home page, opening screens, showing tap indicators — as if a real user were using the app.

## About the Design Files
The files in this bundle are **design references created in HTML** — a working prototype showing intended look and behavior, not production code to copy directly. Recreate this in the target codebase's environment (e.g. a React component on the glasspay.app landing page) using its established patterns. `Glasspay Phone Hero.dc.html` is the reference implementation; its `<x-dc>` template body is plain HTML with inline styles and its logic class is plain React-style JS — both port directly to a React component.

## Fidelity
**High-fidelity.** The home screen is a pixel-accurate recreation of the app's Home page; all other screens are real app exports (PNGs in `assets/`). Timings, easings, and coordinates below are final.

## How It Works (core technique)
1. **Base image**: `assets/iphone.png` (876×791, transparent PNG) rendered at natural size, bottom-anchored, centered.
2. **Live screen overlay**: a `div` of logical size **393×852** (iPhone screen), `transform-origin: 0 0`, `border-radius: 56px`, `overflow: hidden`, mapped onto the photo's tilted screen with a CSS `matrix3d` **homography** computed from four corner points (in image pixel coords):
   - top-left (628, 29), top-right (856, 5), bottom-left (476, 566), bottom-right (703, 560)
   - The `homography(w, h, corners)` function in the reference file computes the matrix3d string (standard 4-point projective mapping: basisToPoints / adjugate method). Port it verbatim.
3. **Scenes**: inside the screen div, the home page is the base layer; every other screen is an absolutely-positioned full-size `<img>` of a real app export that slides in/out with `transform: translateX(105%) ↔ 0`, `transition: transform 480ms cubic-bezier(0.32,0.72,0.3,1)`, `box-shadow: -24px 0 48px rgba(0,0,0,0.14)` (iOS push feel). The drawer slides from the left (`translateX(-105%)`) with a scrim (`rgba(10,12,30,0.35)`, 420ms opacity fade). The receipt slides up from the bottom (`translateY(105%) ↔ 0`, 520ms) as a sheet on an `#E9EBF2` backdrop, receipt image 361px wide, radius 12px.
4. **Home scroll**: the home content wrapper animates `translateY` between 0 and `-(scrollHeight − 852)` with `transition: transform 2.2s cubic-bezier(0.45,0,0.2,1)`.
5. **Tap indicator**: a 44px circle (`rgba(28,43,138,0.30)`, 2px `rgba(255,255,255,0.75)` border) shown at each tap point for 650ms with a scale 0.4→1→1.15 + fade keyframe (600ms).
6. **Status bar**: fixed on top of everything — black dynamic-island pill 125×37 at top:11px centered (radius 20), "9:41" at (42, 20) 15px/600, battery glyph top-right. `pointer-events: none`.
7. **Notification tabs**: the notification center is one sliding container holding three stacked screen images (payments/community/invites) crossfaded via `opacity`, 220ms.

## Timeline (one loop, ms — see `loop()` in the reference file for exact code)
| t | action |
|---|--------|
| 1000–7750 | tap bell (355,78) → notifications in; tab to Community (196,136) at 3200; tab to Invites (318,136) at 5000; back (40,68) → out |
| 8500 | home scrolls to bottom |
| 11600–18850 | tap history row (196,620) → Transaction Details; tap Share Receipt (196,708) → receipt sheet up (2.8s) → down; back → details out |
| 19400 | home scrolls back to top |
| 21900–32050 | tap Pay Now (196,430) → Payment Summary; tap Make Payment (196,545) → Success; tap Share Receipt (196,776) → receipt sheet; tap Back to Home (196,706) → success + summary out |
| 33200–38550 | tap menu (30,78) → drawer in; tap Manage Payments (100,180) → drawer out, Manage Payments in; back → out |
| 39600–56050 | tap menu → drawer; tap Settings (72,236) → Settings in; tap Profile (196,233) → in/back; tap My Communities (196,784) → in/back; tap Auto-Pay (196,612) → in/back; settings out |
| 57300 | loop restarts |

All tap coordinates are in the 393×852 screen space. Implement as a `setTimeout` chain rebuilt each loop (clear all timers on unmount).

## Assets (all in `assets/`)
`iphone.png` (hand photo), `screen-transaction-details.png`, `screen-payment-summary.png`, `screen-success.png`, `screen-settings.png`, `screen-autopay.png`, `screen-manage-payments.png`, `screen-profile.png`, `screen-my-communities.png`, `drawer.png` (334px wide, left-anchored), `receipt.png`, `notifications-payments.png`, `notifications-community.png`, `notifications-invites.png`. All screen exports render at `width/height: 100%; object-fit: cover; object-position: top center` inside the 393×852 screen.

## State Management
- `homeScroll: number` — home page translateY
- `ov: { details, summary, success, settings, autopay, drawer, manage, receipt, profile, communities, notif }` — booleans, one per overlay
- `notifTab: 'payments' | 'community' | 'invites'`
- `tap: {x, y} | null` — cleared 650ms after set
- Timer array for the loop; clear on unmount. No data fetching.

## Files
- `Glasspay Phone Hero.dc.html` — reference implementation (template between `<x-dc>` tags + `Component` logic class; ignore the `support.js` include, it's the prototype runtime)
- `assets/` — all images
