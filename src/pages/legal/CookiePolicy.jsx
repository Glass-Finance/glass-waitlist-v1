      <p>
        This Cookie Policy explains how Glass Finance Limited ("Glass," "we," "us," "our")
        uses cookies and similar technologies on our website and applications (the
        "Platform"). This Policy supplements our <Link to="/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link>{" "}
        and should be read alongside it. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meaning
        given in the <Link to="/terms">Terms of Service</Link>.
      </p>

      <h2>1. What Are Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files placed on your device when you visit a website or use an
        application. They allow the Platform to recognize your device, remember your
        preferences, and support essential functionality such as staying logged in. We also use
        similar technologies, including local storage, mobile SDK identifiers, and pixel tags,
        which are collectively referred to as "cookies" in this Policy unless otherwise
        specified.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Essential Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Essential cookies are strictly necessary for the Platform to function, including
        enabling secure log-in, processing payments, and maintaining Platform stability. These
        cookies do not require consent because the Platform cannot operate without them, and
        they cannot be disabled through our cookie settings (though you may block them via your
        browser, which may prevent the Platform from working correctly).
      </p>

      <h2>3. Authentication Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        We use cookies to recognize you as a logged-in User across pages and sessions, so you
        do not need to re-enter your credentials on every page. These cookies are essential to
        Account security and Platform functionality.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Security Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        We use cookies to detect suspicious activity, prevent fraud, enforce our{" "}
        <Link to="/acceptable-use">Acceptable Use Policy</Link>, and protect Accounts from
        unauthorized access, including cookies that support device fingerprinting for
        fraud-risk scoring in coordination with our Payment Processor and KYC Provider.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Analytics Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        We use analytics cookies to understand how Users interact with the Platform — for
        example, which features are used most, how Users navigate between pages, and where
        Users encounter errors. This helps us improve the Platform. Analytics cookies are
        non-essential and are only set with your consent, where required by Applicable Law.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Performance Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Performance cookies help us monitor Platform speed, stability, and error rates,
        allowing us to diagnose and resolve technical issues. Where these cookies are
        non-essential, they are only set with your consent.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Preference Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Preference cookies remember your settings and choices, such as language, currency
        display, or notification preferences, so you do not need to reconfigure them on each
        visit.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Session Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Session cookies are temporary and are deleted when you close your browser or app
        session. We use session cookies to maintain Platform state during a single visit, such
        as keeping you logged in while you navigate between pages of a payment flow.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Some cookies on the Platform are set by third parties who provide services to us, such
        as analytics providers, and, where applicable, our Payment Processor's embedded payment
        widgets. These third parties may use cookies to provide fraud detection, analytics, or
        payment functionality, subject to their own privacy and cookie policies. We do not
        permit third-party advertising cookies on the Platform.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Managing Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Where required by Applicable Law, we will present a cookie consent banner or settings
        panel allowing you to accept or reject non-essential cookies (analytics, performance,
        and preference cookies) when you first visit the Platform, and to change your
        preferences at any time through Platform settings.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Browser Settings</h2>
      <p>
        Most browsers allow you to block or delete cookies through their settings.
        Instructions vary by browser; please consult your browser's help documentation. Please
        note that blocking essential cookies may prevent you from logging in, making payments,
        or using core Platform features.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Consent</h2>
      <p>
        By using the Platform and, where applicable, accepting our cookie banner, you consent
        to our use of essential and (where you accept them) non-essential cookies as described
        in this Policy. You may withdraw consent to non-essential cookies at any time through
        Platform settings or your browser, without affecting the lawfulness of prior use based
        on consent already given.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Cookie retention periods vary by type: session cookies are deleted when you close your
        session; authentication cookies typically persist for the length of a login session or
        a limited "remember me" period; analytics and preference cookies typically persist for
        up to twelve (12) months, after which they expire or are refreshed upon renewed
        consent.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Future Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        As the Platform evolves, we may adopt additional tracking or personalization
        technologies (for example, in connection with future wallet, savings, or AI-powered
        financial insight features). Where such technologies involve non-essential cookies or
        similar tracking, we will update this Policy and, where required by Applicable Law,
        obtain your consent before deployment.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the cookies and
        technologies we use. Material changes will be communicated through the Platform with an
        updated "Last Updated" date.
