# Glass Design System

**Source of truth:** Figma file _Glass Design By AQ_ — `figma.com/design/OzgMHnZ528nzYyElv5LZDd`
**Extracted:** 2026-10-07 via Figma REST API (`GET /v1/files/OzgMHnZ528nzYyElv5LZDd`)
**Re-audited:** 2026-10-09 — full-file pass; typography, icons and the component sheet inventoried (§7–§9)
**Applies to:** `glass-waitlist` (app → app.glasspay.app) and `glass-waitlist-v1` (marketing → glasspay.app)

> This document is normative. When code disagrees with this file, the code is wrong — unless
> §0 says otherwise. Do not "clean up" a value to match a Tailwind default; match this spec.

## 0. Read this first — three things that will trip you up

1. **The Figma file has no variables or styles layer.** `GET /files/:key/styles` returns
   `styles: []`, and `POST /files/:key/variables/local` returns 403 (needs the
   `file_variables:read` scope). Everything below was extracted from **node fills, strokes,
   radii and text styles**. Treat single-use values as provisional; treat high-frequency
   values (`#002fa7` at 2,812 nodes) as authoritative.

2. **The Figma MCP connection does not work and cannot be made to work.** Figma's OAuth
   server only accepts clients in a fixed catalog (VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code, Codex,
   Windsurf, Xcode, Zed). `POST https://api.figma.com/v1/oauth/mcp/register` returns **403**.
   Don't retry `opencode mcp auth figma` — it fails with _"OAuth app with client id … doesn't
   exist"_. Use a Figma personal access token (File content → Read-only) and the REST API.

3. **The Figma file is internally inconsistent.** Only `Primary Button + States` (id
   `1:11545`) has real, trustworthy variant props. Several other component sets were never
   cleaned up — their variants are literally named `Variant21`, `Variant8`, `Variant12`.
   Where a set contradicts itself, this document follows `Primary Button + States`.

## 1. Colour

### 1.1 Core palette

| Role                  | Hex       | Notes                                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Brand**             | `#002fa7` | The only brand blue. 2,812 nodes. Highest-confidence value in the file. |
| **Danger / Critical** | `#db0000` | 276 nodes. Destructive button + outline-caution label.                  |
| **Focus ring**        | `#0f53ff` | Focus stroke colour. Currently **0 occurrences** in either repo.        |
| **Deep navy text**    | `#001f6e` | 248 nodes. Figma's dark heading/text navy.                              |
| **Purple**            | `#6b2fb5` | 242 nodes. The file's only purple.                                      |

### 1.2 Blue tint ramp

`#ccdaff` (425) · `#6a8ff0` (212) · `#bdd0fe` (131) · `#dbe6ff` (29) · `#ccdbff` (19) · `#94b1fb` (60)

Ordered lightest → darkest: `#ccdaff` · `#bdd0fe` · `#dbe6ff` · `#94b1fb` · `#6a8ff0`.

### 1.3 Neutrals & surfaces

| Hex       | Nodes | Use                                       |
| --------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `#ffffff` | 3,810 | Page/cards; also tonal button fill at 60% |
| `#f9f9fb` | 300   | Page background                           |
| `#f3f4f6` | 338   | Subtle surface / stacked                  |
| `#f2f2f2` | 20    | Hairline surface                          |
| `#d7d8db` | 54    | Divider                                   |
| `#e0e0eb` | 8     | Hairline border                           |
| `#ccd1dc` | 5     | Border                                    |

### 1.4 Text ramp

`#000000` · `#000000 @60%` · `#000000 @32%` · `#000000 @20%` · `#808080` · `#848484` ·
`#a1a1aa` · `#797d86` · `#6a6e86` · `#5c5f7d`

### 1.5 Radius scale

**4 · 8 · 12 · 16.** Observed node counts: 4 → 1,792 · 12 → 441 · 8 → 357 · 16 → 56.
Four values. Anything else (`rounded-md` 6, `rounded-2xl` 16, arbitrary `[10px]`/`[20px]`/`[46px]`) is off-system.

> **Pill exception (confirmed 2026-10-09, extended 2026-10-10):** `rounded-full` is legal on
> **toggle tracks** (Figma r=100), **frequency badges** (r=24/999), **status chips**, and
> **landing CTAs** (r=60, see §2.2b) — the file uses pills there deliberately. It stays banned
> on product buttons, cards, inputs and modals.

> Note: an earlier version of `design-audit.md` claimed a `6` in the scale. There is no 6.
> One `Dialog` node carries r=24, outside the scale — provisional, see §9.3.

### 1.6 Banned values

These appear in the code and are **not** in Figma. Do not introduce them; retire them.

## 2. Buttons

Six roles. All **Inter**, label weight **500**, border radius **4px at rest**.

### 2.1 Role matrix

| Role         | Fill           | Label                             | Stroke              | Radius              |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Primary**  | `#002fa7`      | `#ffffff`                         | —                   | **4px, all states** |
| **Outline**  | **none**       | `#002fa7` · `#000000` · `#db0000` | `#000000 @10%`, 1px | 4px                 |
| **Tertiary** | none           | `#002fa7` · `#db0000`             | none                | 4px, height 24      |
| **Critical** | `#db0000`      | `#ffffff`                         | —                   | 4px                 |
| **Tonal**    | `#ffffff @60%` | `#002fa7`                         | `#000000 @10%`, 1px | 4px                 |

> ### ⚠️ Extension: Success and Warning are NOT in Figma
>
> The Figma file defines **no** success or warning button role. These two were added on the
> design owner's instruction, and are marked here as an **extension rather than spec** — if the
> file later grows a real status role, prefer that.
>
> To avoid inventing a palette, both use fills the file **already reaches for elsewhere**:
> `#008000` (its dominant green, 435 nodes) and `#9a6500` (its dominant amber, 91 nodes).
> Washes are `#ccffcc` (183) and `#ffffdb` (56); the danger wash is `#ffcccc` (27). These
> replaced Tailwind's green-600 / amber-700 / emerald-50 / amber-50 / red-50, none of which
> appear anywhere in the file.
>
> `_SUCCESS_` · `_WARNING_` — fill as above, label `#ffffff`, 4px, full state set.
> **Blast radius:** `--color-success` had 192 references and `--color-warning` 74, so adopting
> these values is a visible change across status chips, banners and buttons. Review it.
> | _(focus)_ | — | — | `#0f53ff` | — |

> ### Radius decision: 4px, everywhere
>
> Figma's `Primary Button + States` is internally inconsistent — several _Hover_/_Pressed_
> variants are 8px while their _Default_ is 4px, and the X-large row mixes both. **Per the
> design owner: when the spec is ambiguous, take the smaller value. 4 < 8, so 4px wins.**
>
> This means **4px at every state, on every role** — including hover, pressed, disabled and
> focus. Do not ship an 8px hover radius. `rounded-lg` (8px) is wrong everywhere; use
> `rounded-g-1` (4px).
>
> The four values are available as `--radius-g-1` (4px) · `--radius-g-2` (8px) ·
> `--radius-g-3` (12px) · `--radius-g-4` (16px), added to `src/index.css` `@theme`. The `g-`
> prefix is deliberate: reusing Tailwind's built-in `--radius-sm/md/lg` names would remap
> every existing card and input to larger radii, which is the opposite of this decision.

> **The outline family is one component in three colours.** `Secondary/Outline` (1:11673),
> `Outline Secondary Button` (1:11983) and `Outline Caution Button` (1:11800) are
> _geometrically identical_ — same no-fill, same `#000000 @10%` 1px stroke, same radii and
> heights. They differ **only** in label colour: blue / black / red. They are not broken
> duplicates.

### 2.2 Sizes

| Size    | Padding T/R/B/L | Height | Label |
| ------- | --------------- | ------ | ----- |
| X-small | 8/12/8/12       | 32     | 12px  |
| Small   | 8/16/8/16       | 40     | 14px  |
| Medium  | 12/24/12/24     | 48     | 14px  |
| Large   | 16/32/16/32     | 56     | 16px  |
| X-large | 20/40/20/40     | 64     | 16px  |

Heights are the quick check: **32 · 40 · 48 · 56 · 64.** Tertiary is 24.
Critical's X-large uses `20/24/20/24` (h=64) — narrower horizontally than Primary's
`20/40/20/40`.

### 2.2a Icon-only sizes (extension)

> ### ⚠️ Extension: Figma defines no icon-button role
>
> Every role in §2.1 assumes a text label, so the app's icon-only buttons — hamburger, bell,
> close, chevron, overflow, trash — had nothing to route through. Added on the design owner's
> instruction as **three sizes**, not a new role: they reuse the existing role fills and states
> and differ only in geometry.
>
> | Size      | Box   | Padding | Label |
> | --------- | ----- | ------- | ----- |
> | `icon-sm` | 32×32 | none    | none  |
> | `icon-md` | 40×40 | none    | none  |
> | `icon-lg` | 48×48 | none    | none  |
>
> 24/32/40 squares were all present in the file; 48 is carried over from the button scale
> because 40 is below the 44px touch-target guidance on phones. **No horizontal padding** —
> there is no label to clear — and no text size, since the child is an icon.
>
> `ui/Button` does **not** add an `aria-label` for you. An icon-only button with no accessible
> name is unusable by screen reader and voice control, so pass one explicitly:
>
> ```jsx
> <Button size="icon-md" aria-label="Notifications">
>   <Bell />
> </Button>
> ```

### 2.2b Landing CTA (extension — the white pill)

> ### ⚠️ Extension: the marketing CTAs are a role of their own
>
> The six roles in §2.1 are **product** buttons. The Figma landing frames (MacBook Air 3–8,
> Home Page section) draw their CTAs differently, confirmed node-by-node 2026-10-10:
>
> | Property | Value                      | Evidence                                      |
> | -------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
> | Fill     | `#fafbfc` (near-white)     | every "Get Started" / "Create Your Community" |
> | Radius   | 60 → pill (`rounded-full`) | r=60 on all instances                         |
> | Height   | 50                         | 50 on all instances                           |
> | Label    | Inter 500, 15px, `#000000` | text nodes                                    |
>
> These are **not** an inversion of Primary and must not be styled via `variant="primary"`.
> They are their own treatment: near-white pill on the brand-navy sections (and on light
> sections too — the fill is the same). Hover/pressed states are not measurable via REST;
> the shared component ships a conservative lift (`-translate-y-0.5` + shadow) until the
> owner rules.
>
> **Scope — exactly these sites** (v1 marketing + the app repo's marketing twins):
> nav "Get Started Free" (desktop + mobile), CTA-section "Create Your Community" /
> "Join Your Community", hero "Create Your Community" / "Join A Community", footer
> "Get Started Free". Implementation is the shared `ui/LandingCta` component — do not
> hand-roll the styles at a call site. **Product surfaces (dashboard, auth, member app)
> never use it.** "Sign In" stays on the outline/text treatment even on landing.

### 2.3 States

| State    | Primary                                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Default  | fill `#002fa7`, radius 4px                          |
| Hover    | fill `#002fa7` + `#000000 @6%` overlay, radius 4px  |
| Pressed  | fill `#002fa7` + `#000000 @12%` overlay, radius 4px |
| Focused  | stroke `#0f53ff`, radius 4px                        |
| Disabled | fill **stays `#002fa7`**, radius 4px                |

Black-over-brand overlays resolve to: hover `#002f9b`, pressed `#002b8f`.

Outline/tertiary/tonal all need the same five states. The pressed treatment is a **colour
overlay on the fill**, not a scale transform.

> The hover/pressed overlays are _stacked black fills_, not `opacity` on the element.
> `hover:opacity-90` is **not** the same thing and is not equivalent.

## 3. Current compliance

**Sweep complete (C1–C8, 2026-10-08 → 2026-10-10).** Re-measured 2026-10-10, both repos.
Batch history: batch 1 shared components (ModalShell/ConfirmDialog/ConfirmSheet), then
C2 toast/chips, C3 destructive, C4 icon-onlys, C5 memberApp, C6 dashboard, C7 auth +
onboarding (app PRs #146–#151), C8 v1 leftovers (v1 PR #26). Evidence trail: `design-audit.md`.

Every role-mappable button is now on `ui/Button`. What remains as raw `<button>` is the
**deliberate leave-list**: composite rows/list-items, dropdown-option menus, tab groups,
segmented controls, radio cards, promo/empty-state cards, KycStatusBadge wrappers, the
dark-navy Sidebar rail, numeric pagination, muted See-All links, destructive text links
(no danger-tertiary role exists), decorative `dashboard-overlay/` mocks (`aria-hidden`,
`tabIndex={-1}`), accordion triggers, and the component definitions themselves.

Radius breakdown of the 122 remaining raw buttons (±4-line window):
`rounded-full` 23 · `rounded-xl` 23 · `rounded-lg` 21 · `rounded-2xl` 12 ·
`rounded-md` 8 · `rounded-[10px]` 7 · `rounded-sm` 2. These are the leave-list
composites and mocks — not un-migrated CTAs. `focus-visible` present in 6
windows; `active:` 0 (owed by raws that stay raw); `font-semibold` 49 /
`font-bold` 9 / no-weight 30 across remaining raw windows.

Fixed since baseline and no longer offenders: global focus ring is
`--color-focus: #0f53ff` (token, not brand), `SideDrawer` red ring →
`outline-focus`, all danger reds → `bg-danger`, `#2535c3` → comment-only
(`SignUpTextInput.jsx:8`), `bg-red-600`/`bg-[#7f1d1d]` gone, JoinApprovedModal
green → `success` extension role, `!important` count 11 → 0.

Counting method: classes within a ±4-line window around each `<button` tag.
JSX attributes are multi-line, so a per-line scan misses most of them — the
same trap that produced the wrong numbers in the original audit.

mobile menu rows, mobile Sign In outline pill (per §6.11 ruling), Security /
WhyGlass accordion triggers, UseCases card-teaser, dashboard-overlay
decorative mocks, LandingCta/Button definitions. C8 (PR #26) converted the
ErrorBoundary refresh pill and ProblemSection ↻ Replay; the UseCases white-fill
outline and Security JS-invert outline from §4.3 were fixed in the landing
batch (PR #25).

---

## 4. Offenders

Status 2026-10-10, after the C1–C8 sweep. Most of the original §4 inventory is
**resolved**; the tables below keep the historical rows so the trail survives,
struck through where fixed. What remains open is listed at the end.

### 4.1 Critical — wrong colour — **RESOLVED**

- ~~Primary CTAs inverted to `bg-white` + off-palette navy label (9 v1 sites)~~ → `ui/LandingCta` (§2.2b, user decision 2026-10-10).
- ~~Danger rendered with 5 different reds, none `#db0000`~~ → `bg-danger` token; 101 app sites; `#db0000` count 0 outside tests.
- ~~`#2547d0` as brand blue (19 sites)~~ → 0 in both repos.
- ~~`#2535c3` (`EmailPhoneStep`)~~ → removed; only a comment remains (`SignUpTextInput.jsx:8`).
- ~~Scroll-progress gradient across banned colours (v1 `Navbar.jsx:101`)~~ → removed.
- ~~Red focus ring (`SideDrawer`)~~ → `focus-visible:outline-focus`.
- ~~Global focus ring `#002fa7`~~ → `--color-focus: #0f53ff` token.
- ~~Off-palette green button (`JoinApprovedModal`)~~ → `success` extension role (§2.1).

### 4.2 Critical — wrong radius — **mostly resolved**

`rounded-full` on filled CTAs is down from 61 + 26 to **23 app + 9 v1**, and the
remainder are leave-list items (badges, dark-nav pills, decorative mocks, the
LandingCta shell which legitimately carries the Figma r=60 pill per §2.2b).
`rounded-xl` destructives: all migrated (23 remaining `rounded-xl` windows are
composite rows/cards, not buttons carrying the fill). Spec radius remains
`rounded-g-1` everywhere else.

### 4.3 Critical — role collapse — **RESOLVED**

The grey-pill Cancel collapse (27 app sites, `ConfirmDialog` the canonical
instance) is gone: every cancel/secondary action is `outline`/`outline-neutral`
via `ui/Button`. Tertiary went from 0 uses to the default for text links across
the sweep. v1's `UseCases` white-fill outline and `Security` JS-invert outline
were fixed in the landing batch (PR #25). Remaining raws that still read as
"role-ish" composites (option menus, tab groups, radio cards) are deliberate
leaves — they are containers styled to look like buttons, not buttons.

### 4.4 Critical — a11y — **open, exempt pending owner**

| Issue                                                                               | Status                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5 timeline steps clickable by mouse only — no `role`, no `tabIndex`, no `onKeyDown` | still open — v1 `organizations/ProblemSection.jsx` (`data-role` hooks; keyboard wiring is a feature change) |
| 6 dead focusable buttons in a decorative product mock                               | still `aria-hidden`/`tabIndex={-1}` — v1 `dashboard-overlay/*`; exemption pending §6 owner confirm          |
| 31 legal-prose links with no hover and no focus                                     | still open — v1 `src/index.css` `.legal-prose` (CSS-only fix, not part of the button sweep)                 |

### 4.5 Moderate — sizes and states — **mostly resolved**

- Figma sizes 32/40/48/56/64 now exist in code as `ui/Button` `xs/sm/md/lg/xl`; all 406 call sites carry them. The 10-07 "0 of 56 match" row is void.
- Pressed/focus/disabled states: carried by `ui/Button` for every migrated button; raw leave-list buttons still owe their own (noted in §5).
- Weight 600/700: `ui/Button` renders 500; remaining semibold/bold hits (49/9) are leave-list raws.
- `!important` escapes: **0** (was 11).
- v1 `tailwing.config.js`: **deleted**.

---

## 5. Doing it right

Prefer the shared component over hand-rolled classes:

```jsx
import { Button } from "~/components/ui/Button";

<Button variant="primary" size="md">Pay now</Button>
<Button variant="outline" size="sm">Cancel</Button>
<Button variant="critical" size="md" disabled>Delete</Button>
```

Hand-rolled equivalent — the shape to match when a `<button>` genuinely can't go through the
component:

```jsx
<button
  className="h-12 rounded-g-1 bg-brand px-6 text-sm font-medium text-white
             hover:bg-[#002f9b] active:bg-[#002b8f]
             focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-[#0f53ff]
             disabled:bg-brand disabled:opacity-60"
>
```

- Radius: `rounded-g-1` (4px). **Always.** Never `rounded-lg`, `rounded-xl`, `rounded-full`.
- Height: `h-8` / `h-10` / `h-12` / `h-14` / `h-16` for 32/40/48/56/64.
- Colour: `bg-brand` / `text-white` / `bg-danger`. Never a raw hex.
- Weight: `font-medium` (500). Never `font-semibold` or `font-bold`.
- Label: 12/14/16px only.
- Every button needs hover, pressed, focus and disabled.
- Focus ring is `#0f53ff`, on the element, with an offset.
- `fullWidth` defaults to **true**. Only pass `fullWidth={false}` when the button is sized
  by its parent — e.g. a `flex-1` sibling in a shared row. Getting this backwards silently
  narrows a stacked action. `ConfirmDialog` and `ConfirmSheet` are the reference pair for
  the two cases: side-by-side in a `flex gap-3` row (`fullWidth={false}` + `flex-1`), and
  stacked in a `flex-col` (default).
- A migrated button's **disabled** state cannot be asserted by looking for a `disabled:`
  class — `ui/Button` swaps the whole variant class at render time. Test it functionally
  (`.disabled === true`). See the note in §3.1.

**Do not** add `active:scale-*` as the pressed state. Do not use `opacity` to fake a hover
overlay. Do not add a new hex without checking §1.5 and §1.6 first.

### Icon-only buttons

A raw `<button>` with an `aria-label` and no text child is acceptable when Figma defines no
matching role (§6.7) — but it still owes everything else in §2: `rounded-g-1`, hover, an
`active:` state, and the `#0f53ff` focus ring. `ModalShell`'s close button is the reference
example: one shared `CLOSE_BTN` class string so both of its variants cannot drift, and both
are given an `aria-label` so neither is an unnamed button.

## 6. Open questions for the design owner

Refreshed 2026-10-10 after the button sweep. Struck-through items are resolved
and need nothing from the owner; the shortlist at the bottom is what still does.

1. ~~**Radius 4 vs 8.**~~ **Resolved:** take the smaller value → **4px everywhere**, no 8px
   hover radius. Recorded in §2.1.
2. **`#0f53ff` focus colour.** Applied as the global focus ring per §2.1 (token
   `--color-focus`). **Still needs confirmation** that it is the intended focus
   colour, not a one-off.
3. ~~**No success/warning role.**~~ **Resolved as an extension:** `success` and `warning` roles
   added in §2.1 using the file's own dominant green `#008000` and amber `#9a6500`, replacing
   the off-palette `#16a34a`/`#b45309`. Flagged as an extension, not spec.
4. **Success/status palette.** Figma has `#008000`, `#1d6b40`, `#9a6500`, `#ffffdb` in use but
   no coherent scale. **Open:** is there a status ramp somewhere else?
5. **Decorative `dashboard-overlay/` mocks** (inline styles, radius 7, `aria-hidden`).
   **Open:** confirm they never need to conform. Until then they are exempt and
   explain most remaining v1 hex literals.
6. **Six near-identical navies.** `#0f1d6e`, `#1c2b8a`, `#0b0f2e`, `#0d1a6e`, `#0c1020`,
   `#0d1022`, `#0f1640` all collapse to `#001f6e`. **Open:** confirm, since
   `--color-brand-deep` and `--color-brand-night` currently carry extra meaning in dark
   sections.
7. ~~**No icon-button role exists.**~~ **Resolved as an extension:** three icon-only sizes
   (`icon-sm` 32, `icon-md` 40, `icon-lg` 48) added in §2.2a and used across C4–C7.
8. **Icon glyph scale is provisional (§8.4).** Figma's icon components don't serialize width/
   height via the REST API, so the 16/20/24/32/40 glyph scale is derived from the icon-button
   boxes, not measured. **Open:** confirm — especially the normalisation of the app's `w-9`
   (36px, 60 sites) and `w-7` (28px, 35 sites).
9. **Dialog radius.** The Figma `Dialog` node carries r=24 — outside the 4/8/12/16 scale and on
   a single node. Code uses 16 (`rounded-2xl`) + 20px sheets. **Open:** keeping the code
   values until the owner rules; if 24 is real, §1.5 grows a fifth step.
10. **Marketing display type has no spec.** The Figma file contains app screens only; its
    largest text is 24px. Marketing heroes run `clamp(26px…62px)` and `font-extrabold` (800,
    which §7 bans as above the file's max weight of 700). **Open:** sizes stay unruled until
    the owner exports marketing frames; weights should come down to ≤700 now.
11. ~~**CTA on navy sections.**~~ **Re-resolved (user decision, 2026-10-10): white pill.**
    The Figma landing frames draw every landing CTA as a `#fafbfc` near-white pill
    (r=60, h=50) — see §2.2b. `ui/LandingCta` implements that at the nine marketing
    call sites; the blue-on-navy shortcut is retired.

### Still needs owner sign-off (shortlist)

1. **Focus colour `#0f53ff`** — confirm (item 2).
2. **Six-navy collapse to `#001f6e`** — confirm, incl. what `brand-deep`/`brand-night`
   should mean (item 6).
3. **Dialog r=24 vs code's 16/20** — rule (item 9).
4. **Marketing display sizes/weights** — export marketing frames or accept the
   ≤700 interim (item 10).
5. **Success/status ramp** — point at the real scale or adopt the extension (item 4).
6. **dashboard-overlay mocks** — confirm permanent exemption (item 5).
7. **Icon glyph scale** — confirm derived 16/20/24/32/40 (item 8).

No further code work is planned on these until the owner rules; the page audit
(every app page except the landing vs this spec) proceeds independently.

## 7. Typography

Full-file pass 2026-10-09 — 587 text nodes.

**The file is single-font: Inter.** Every product text node is Inter. The only exception is
one stray `Urbanist` label on the "Color Tonals" annotation — design-sheet chrome, not
product UI.

### 7.1 Scale (product UI)

| Size | Weight | Line-height | Where                               | Freq |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ---- |
| 12   | 500    | 14.5–24     | small buttons, chips                | 59   |
| 14   | 400    | 20          | table cells, meta text              | 31   |
| 14   | 500    | 20 / 24     | buttons (small/medium), labels      | 33   |
| 16   | 400    | 24          | body, table cell text               | 77   |
| 16   | 500    | 24          | buttons (large), inputs, prefixes   | 190  |
| 18   | 500    | 21.8–24     | card titles, settings rows          | 16   |
| 22   | 500    | 28          | table titles, dialog titles, values | 11   |
| 24   | 500    | 29          | rare                                | 2    |

Weights present: **400, 500, 600** (2 nodes), **700** (names/emails in mock data + one C2
chip). **500 is the default.** 400 for body/table text. 600/700 appear only in mock data and
annotations — do not promote them to product headings without the owner saying so.

Letter-spacing: body is 0; the 12/14px button labels carry ~1% (Figma stores 0.012–0.014 px
at those sizes). `ui/Button` applies none today — provisional, do not invent tracking
elsewhere.

### 7.2 Code verdicts

| `font-extrabold` (800), 3 v1 + 4 app sites                     | **Change: use 700.** 800 exceeds the file's max weight — and neither repo even loads Inter 800.                                                                              |
| Buttons 12/14/16px @ weight 500                                | **Fine** — §2.2 already enforces this.                                                                                                                                       |
| JetBrains Mono accent chips (`MembersProblem.jsx`, both repos) | **Accepted deviation.** The file has no mono text; these uppercase-tracked label chips are a deliberate landing-page accent. Do not extend mono elsewhere without the owner. |

## 8. Icons

### 8.1 Library: lucide-react — keep it

The code's icon library is **`lucide-react`** (122 files in the app, 7 in v1). Keep it. The
Figma Icons section (`1:4232`, ~58 components) is a grab bag of iconify sets —
`material-symbols-light`, `lets-icons`, `iconamoon`, `vuesax`, `fluent`, `tdesign`, `weui` —
plus hand-drawn vectors. Rebuilding on those sets would mean adding seven icon dependencies
and restyling every surface. The spec is the **shape**, not the source: match the mapping
below.

### 8.2 Mapping — Figma name → lucide

### 8.3 Status & selection icons are illustrations, not glyphs

`StatusIcon/*` (Checkmark, AddUser, Plans, Amount, failedPayments, Time, InactiveUser,
Users), `SelectionCard/*` (Recurring, Persons, Memberadd, NonPaying, PayingMember, Flash),
`FeedbackIcon/Success` and `PopUpIcon/*` are **multicolour filled illustrations**, not line
glyphs. `common/SuccessBadge.jsx` is already the reference implementation of
`FeedbackIcon/Success` — it was measured off the design asset (seal bbox, check polyline,
accent positions); keep it in sync if that asset ever changes. For the rest, use a coloured
lucide glyph inside a status-wash circle (`bg-<wash>` + `text-<status>`, palette §2.1
extension note and §9.1) until the owner exports real assets. **Do not hand-trace vectors.**

### 8.4 Sizes

Glyph boxes do not serialize in the REST payload (width/height null on all 58 icon
components), so this scale is **provisional** (open question §6.8), derived from the
icon-button boxes (§2.2a) and the button label scale:

| Step      | Glyph | Tailwind |
| --------- | ----- | -------- |
| `icon-xs` | 16    | `w-4`    |
| `icon-sm` | 20    | `w-5`    |
| `icon-md` | 24    | `w-6`    |
| `icon-lg` | 32    | `w-8`    |
| `icon-xl` | 40    | `w-10`   |

Glyph inside a §2.2a icon-only button: box − 16px padding budget → 16 / 24 / 32 for
`icon-sm`/`icon-md`/`icon-lg` buttons.

Observed in the app: `w-9` (36px) ×60 and `w-7` (28px) ×35 — both off-scale. **Reclassified
2026-10-09:** these are icon-button _boxes_, avatar chips and logo assets (`w-9 h-9` /
`w-7 h-7` containers), not bare glyph sites — zero bare-glyph hits. They are queued with the
icon-button migration (§2.2a boxes are 32/40/48) rather than this scale; do not bulk-rewrite
them. `w-4`/`w-5`/`w-6`/`w-8`/`w-10` remain fine. Icons on touch targets keep the 44px
minimum (§2.2a rationale).

## 9. Components

Full inventory of the Components section (`1:12168`), 2026-10-09. Verdicts: **fine** (exists,
conforms) · **change** (exists but diverges — action named) · **missing** (no shared
counterpart; values below are the spec when it gets built) · **n/a** (asset or exempt).

### 9.1 Badges — the palette is the spec
